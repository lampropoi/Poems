# Poems Snack app

This is a react native application that displays a list of poems
 
The data for each song, which currently are just dummy data are stored in a Google spreadsheet and I use the [GraphQLSheet app](https://graphqlsheet.com/) to fetch them. The navigation is done with the `react-navigation` and for styling we use the Stylesheet API.

This project is exported from Snack :)
